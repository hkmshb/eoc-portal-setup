# EOC-Setup

An end-to-end deployment setup for the EOC data portal and associated ELK stack for
local development which tries to replicate the exact workings of the production env.

Note: at the moment its more or less for ELK development as the custom extensions
are pulled in from Github directly. The next step would be to define envvars that
allow the setup use local repositories of target CKAN extensions.
